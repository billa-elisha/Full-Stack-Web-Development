# Doctype in Html #
The doctype is an html element that is required at the top of every html document.

This is important in order to support websites that was build before the wide spread of web standards because browsers can display html documents in two modes
* **quirk mode :** displaying the html page without totally apply the html standards ( how the page should be rendered) 
* **no quirks mode :** rendering the html and hopefully applying the html displaying standards 

So the doctype tag tells the browser to render the website by using the **no quirks mode**
